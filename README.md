# Code exercise

Please follow these steps to complete this exercise.

## Homework

Imagine you're building a website for a portfolio, and you want to have a profile card element that
can be configured and reused easily, it's interactive and of course pretty.
- Implement a custom HTML element: Profile card -> &lt;profile-card> &lt;/profile-card>
    - Use Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML for your component
    - Add tests for the element, you can use selenium or follow a more challenging approach doing unit tests for it.
    - What if you wanted it to preserve its own styling among websites?

## Recommendations & tips   

- Consider creating a branch and storing your work there
- Use your imagination and feel free to ask questions

## SMFR

Remember init the project:<pre><code>npm i
</code></pre>
- Create my own profile-card: <pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>
- Test cases: <pre><code>npm run test
</code></pre>

## Considerations:
- My html file with javascript, css vanilla has inputs to be able to test the layer directly there.
- My test cases create html files to check that they are usable anywhere.
- Simplicity is pretty to me.
- All information except mine is fake.
